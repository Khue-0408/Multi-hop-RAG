Despite this, Trump valued the property in financial statements at $US524.7 million and $US527.2 million, respectively, for those years.\n\nBloomberg uses a capitalisation of net income approach in coming up with an estimate. Valuations for commercial offices across the board have taken a hit in the past 18 months amid rising interest rates and a lacklustre corporate leasing market. But 40 Wall Street has its own unique problems.\n-----",

A varying number have been rent-stabilised, meaning tenants pay below market rates. Typically, these apartments are valued at a discount because tenants can stay indefinitely, sometimes even passing them on to children. In 2010, 12 rent-stabilised apartments owned by Trump were valued at an average of $US62,500 each in an appraisal provided by a real estate company.\n-----",

In June, Twitch launched the Partner Plus program, a new monetization tier that would grant eligible creators a 70/30 subscription revenue split on the first $100,000 they make per year.

Streamers need at least 350 monthly paid subscriptions, and gift subs and monthly subs that come with an Amazon Prime account don\u2019t count.\n\nIn response, Twitch pivoted eligibility to a points-based system, assigning a value to each subscription tier.

So what we\u2019re actively working on is, as advertisers that come in through Amazon advertising, that they understand the magic of Twitch, that they can easily set up influencer deals programmatically. And ultimately, you don\u2019t have the measurement that they expect.\n\nBut because of Amazon\u2019s diversity of advertisers, this is where before it was more focused on endemic advertisers, game publishers, et cetera. And now we\u2019re able to expand that reach to a much broader set of advertisers and serve the needs of both the affiliate marketing end of sponsorships, which is more of a performance model, as well as more of the top of the funnel, where you\u2019re looking for more brand awareness.\n\nObviously a lot of this discord among Twitch\u2019s community also comes at a time when other streaming platforms like YouTube or Kick are starting to take off, and enticing streamers with better revenue splits.\n-----",

What is Twitch doing to keep those streamers?\n\nThere are a couple of things that I\u2019ll point out. One is acknowledging what Dan has done as the CEO to get out and engage with streamers, hear their concerns, and really influence our priorities as a company, is really a consequence of him both being an active streamer as well as being extremely engaged within the community.\n\nAnd then, more broadly for both Jeremy [Jeremy Forrester is VP of Community Product] and myself as the product leaders, building the product is continuing to innovate and ensure that we are absolutely a unique service. Whether that\u2019s features, like we\u2019re working on Stories, whether that\u2019s monetization \u2014 it\u2019s all in service of ensuring that livestreaming creators can be more successful on Twitch.\n-----",

The geopolitics of US-China tensions, chip wars, decoupling and \u201cfriendshoring\u201d seem, in particular, to be working significantly in Japan\u2019s favour. Asia-focused global investment is rotating out of China and into Tokyo stocks, real estate and other assets, just as large parts of corporate Japan are engaging more actively with shareholders than at any time in the past.\n\nChina, after years of stunning growth and investor attention, is very rapidly losing that sheen. Its economy is growing more slowly and the expected post-pandemic rebound is proving elusive. On top of that, Beijing\u2019s policymaking \u2014 with its sudden crackdowns on entire industries, like video games and private tutoring, has generated a series of nasty surprises \u2014 and the unshakeable fear that others could occur at any time.\n-----",

Part of that, he says, is generational. Companies that replace their chief executive on five or seven year cycles now have leaders that reached their positions after the establishment of Japan\u2019s stewardship code (in 2014) and corporate governance code (2015). Many have a very different view of the role of a chief executive than their predecessors did.\n-----",

So if Musk fails to satisfy EU regulators, he could face serious consequences for what remains a highly indebted business.\n\nIn his letter to Musk, Breton writes that the EU has \u201cindications\u201d that X is being used to disseminate illegal content and disinformation in the EU\u201d following Saturday\u2019s attacks. He then goes on to remind the company of the DSA\u2019s \u201cvery precise obligations\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis content moderation.\n-----",

His product would no longer be shown in Amazon\u2019s all-important buy box, an area of the listing where shoppers click \u201cAdd to Cart.\u201d Ruckel is the sole seller of the Ripple Rug on Amazon, so the move all but ensured his product would disappear from the website, costing him thousands of dollars per day.\n-----",

Looking back on all that had changed around what first attracted people to Google, from the introduction of ads to the efforts to keep users within the universe of Google products, this seemed to be the last straw.\n\nThe second major reason why Google results feel different lately was, of course, SEO \u2014 specifically, the obnoxious-kid-refusing-to-behave-in-class kind of SEO.\n\n\u201cSEO that goes against Google\u2019s guidelines, it\u2019s not new,\u201d Ray explained.\n-----",

The company brings in hundreds of billions of dollars a year, profits that skew Google\u2019s choices and priorities.

That will continue with both the Steam Deck OLED and the original Steam Deck, the latter of which will get a fresh BIOS update to align itself with some of the former\u2019s upgrades. The original device will see some battery life improvement; just don\u2019t expect the OLED model\u2019s jump of 30-50%.\n-----",

Apologies to anyone who literally bought a Steam Deck yesterday.\n\nAt an event held for press prior to the device's launch, Greg Coomer, a product designer at Valve, called the new model \"the definitive version of the Steam Deck.\" He explained that the device contains many things the company wanted to include at the LCD model's launch but wasn't able to, along with some additions based on community feedback.\n\nAs its name suggests, the most noticeable upgrade to the Steam Deck OLED is the display.

The Steam Deck OLED now includes a Wi-Fi 6E radio (great if you have a modern router and connection to make use of it) and a dedicated Bluetooth module, which allows for improved audio quality with wireless headphones, the option to wake the Steam Deck from a controller, and the capability to connect many Bluetooth controllers for multiplayer.

Closer to the ground, TechCrunch+ is working to understand where startups might find footholds in the market by levering large language models (LLMs), a recent and impactful new method of creating artificially intelligent software.\n\nHow AI will play in startup land is not a new topic of conversation. A few years back, one venture firm asked how AI-focused startups would monetize and whether they would suffer from impaired margins due to costs relating to running models on behalf of customers.

Subscribe here!\n\nRoblox is determined to be a platform, even more than a product \u2014 something users can develop games and experiences within. It sounds quite a lot like a metaverse idea, but you\u2019ll hear David say he doesn\u2019t particularly like using that term.\n-----",

The problem was recently detailed in a report on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, which led with a shocking statistic. When online magazine The Atlantic modeled what would happen if Google integrated AI into search, it found that 75% of the time the AI would answer the user\u2019s query without requiring a click-through to its website, losing it traffic.

The problem was recently detailed in a report on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, which led with a shocking statistic. When online magazine The Atlantic modeled what would happen if Google integrated AI into search, it found that 75% of the time the AI would answer the user\u2019s query without requiring a click-through to its website, losing it traffic. This could have a major impact on publishers\u2019 traffic going forward, as Google today drives nearly 40% of their traffic, according to data from Similarweb.\n-----",
