Depending on what evidence is introduced during the trial, it could be rough for the entire crypto industry.\n\n\u201cHow much damage can this trial do to the already beaten-down reputation of the industry at this point?\u201d asks Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. \u201cThis trial is going to be an excruciating moment for the industry because no one knows what kind of evidence might come out.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried, the founder of FTX and Alameda Research, is facing seven counts of criminal charges: two counts of wire fraud, and five counts of conspiracy charges. FTX was a failed cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2019. According to a now-deleted profile from FTX investors Sequoia Capital, FTX was founded because of Bankman-Fried\u2019s frustration with other exchanges when he was running Alameda Research, his crypto trading firm.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: SBF\u2019s trial starts soon, but how did he \u2014 and FTX \u2014 get here?\npublished_at: 2023-10-01T14:00:29+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nSBF\u2019s trial has started, this is how he and FTX got here\n\nThe highly anticipated criminal trial for Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, started Tuesday to determine whether he\u2019s guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. And as one former federal prosecutor put it: \u201cThe odds seem to be stacked against him at this point.\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old co-founded FTX in 2019; within a few years the once third-largest crypto exchange\u2019s valuation hit $32 billion at its peak. It\u2019s now trying to claw back any funds to distribute to creditors.\n\nBut how did the once third-largest crypto exchange get here?\n\nBefore FTX, Bankman-Fried co-founded crypto-trading firm Alameda Research in 2017. He co-founded FTX in 2019 as a complement to Alameda, to help bring in revenue and liquidity for the trading arm.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: SBF\u2019s trial starts soon, but how did he \u2014 and FTX \u2014 get here?\npublished_at: 2023-10-01T14:00:29+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) alongside the criminal charges. Wang and Ellison plan to cooperate with prosecutors and will be major witnesses in the trial, given their close ties to Bankman-Fried, FTX and Alameda.\n\nIn January, Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to all counts, which include wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to misuse customer funds. He could face up to 115 years in jail if convicted on all charges.\n\nThe crypto industry as a whole suffered from FTX\u2019s collapse, which was the first of many. BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 in November 2022, as did Genesis Global Trading in January.\n\nWhere we are today\n\nBankman-Fried will be represented by Cohen & Gresser, and Mark Cohen, a high-profile defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, will be the lead attorney.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The FTX trial is bigger than Sam Bankman-Fried\npublished_at: 2023-09-28T12:00:00+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nI think it\u2019s important for people to think I look crazy.\u201d)\n\nBecause he was so successful at this kind of public relations, his fall from grace was another mark against an industry that was already roiled by bankruptcies and scandals. Some additional trouble for the crypto industry is likely to come from one crucial element of the fraud trial \u2014 the part where the government must prove intent.\n\nThe first part of proving the government\u2019s case is pretty simple and a little boring: prosecutors must show that certain transactions took place. Whatever records the Southern District of New York has for the transactions will be shown.\n\n\u201cWhat conversations happened between him and his co-conspirators that are now cooperating against him?\u201d\n\nThe second part is where all the drama is likely to come, says Christopher LaVigne, a litigation partner and co-chair of the cryptocurrency practice at the law firm Withers. Prosecutors have to connect those transactions to Bankman-Fried, show that he knew what he was doing was wrong, and prove that he lied about it anyway.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: How is it still getting worse for Sam Bankman-Fried?\npublished_at: 2023-10-12T23:08:14+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nNot great!\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is on trial for seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy. FTX was a fraud \u201cfrom the start,\u201d the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges \u2014 with a \u201cmulti-billion-dollar deficiency caused by his own misappropriation of customer funds.\u201d Follow along for all the latest news and regular updates from the trial.\n\nBut a lot of testimony relied on Ellison recounting conversations she\u2019d had in person, or on auto-deleting text messaging platforms. This gave the defense an opportunity to try to make her sound unreliable. After all, she had an incentive to flip on Bankman-Fried: the possibility of leniency in her sentencing. Given her fun tweets about speed, the fact that she was Bankman-Fried\u2019s ex-girlfriend, and that she\u2019d apparently written a bunch of stuff down, I was expecting fireworks. For the first time in this trial, maybe the defense had an opening.\n\nInstead, I got a sad trombone.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The FTX trial is bigger than Sam Bankman-Fried\npublished_at: 2023-09-28T12:00:00+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThat effectively exempted Alameda from the kinds of risk management other customers faced. At the same time, the government alleges, \u201cBankman-Fried publicly and repeatedly asserted that Alameda did not have privileged access to FTX.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried is accused of using \u201cbillions of dollars in misappropriated FTX customer deposits\u201d to help buy more than $200 million of real estate for himself, make billions of dollars of investments for his own interest, and repay Alameda\u2019s lenders, according to the indictment, Additionally, Bankman-Fried allegedly used more than $100 million of customer funds to make political contributions; prosecutors can show evidence of those contributions in this trial, even though they aren\u2019t part of the charges brought. A second trial is scheduled for March 2024, with additional charges.\n\nBefore his fall, Bankman-Fried made himself out to be the Good Boy of crypto \u2014 the trustworthy face of a sometimes-shady industry.\n-----",

No apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount, James said.\n\nTrump valued Mar-a-Lago as high as $739 million \u2014 more than 10 times a more reasonable estimate of its worth.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The $777 million surprise: Donald Trump is getting richer\npublished_at: 2023-11-07T22:22:05+00:00\nsource: The Age\nExcerpt:\n-----\nBecause of this, New York State arrived at a valuation that was about a third of Trump\u2019s in those years. They haven\u2019t provided a more recent estimate.\n\nSpace inflation wasn\u2019t the only issue. Between 2014 and 2015, Trump increased the value of the apartment to $US327 million from $US200 million. The prosecution argues that was to mask a drop in the value of one of his other properties. \u201cA discrepancy of this order of magnitude, by a real estate developer sizing up his own living space of decades, can only be considered fraud,\u201d Judge Arthur Engoron wrote in a September ruling. \u2018The company has never been stronger and never been better.\u2019 Eric Trump Bloomberg values the property using recent Trump Tower sales, as well as those of comparable Manhattan penthouses. While some splashy residences in much newer buildings on so-called Billionaires Row have listed for well in excess of $US100 million, they typically boast higher ceilings, more up-to-date finishes, contemporary layouts, outdoor space and better views.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The $777 million surprise: Donald Trump is getting richer\npublished_at: 2023-11-07T22:22:05+00:00\nsource: The Age\nExcerpt:\n-----\nBut it\u2019s also likely that the association with Trump would turn off some buyers. Trump Park Avenue Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US90.9 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US86.4 million, New York\u2019s valuation (2021): $US80 million The residential condo tower on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, formerly the Hotel Delmonico, isn\u2019t one of Trump\u2019s best-known buildings, but it\u2019s been the source of some significant asset inflations, according to the prosecution.\n\nIts value to Trump mostly stems from unsold condo units that are owned by the Trump Organisation and rented out. A varying number have been rent-stabilised, meaning tenants pay below market rates. Typically, these apartments are valued at a discount because tenants can stay indefinitely, sometimes even passing them on to children. In 2010, 12 rent-stabilised apartments owned by Trump were valued at an average of $US62,500 each in an appraisal provided by a real estate company.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The $777 million surprise: Donald Trump is getting richer\npublished_at: 2023-11-07T22:22:05+00:00\nsource: The Age\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThousands of pages of exhibits detailing the performance of his assets made available during the trial have provided a deeper look into his fortune. The former president\u2019s 2021 statement of financial condition, filed as part of the lawsuit, pegged his net worth at $US4.5 billion. Bloomberg\u2019s calculation has consistently been below Trump\u2019s figures. At the same time, Bloomberg measured the value of some Trump properties higher than what New York state claims. Trump took the stand and testified that the properties whose values he\u2019s accused of inflating were actually undervalued, based on the premium his \u201cbrand\u201d adds. He also said that banks didn\u2019t rely on his statements of financial condition when weighing loans. \u201cThey just weren\u2019t a very important element in banks\u2019 decision-making process,\u201d Trump told the court. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll explain that as this trial goes along.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at New York state\u2019s valuation of four high-profile Trump properties where the prosecution alleges fraud occurred, along with Bloomberg\u2019s own approach to assessing the assets.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The $777 million surprise: Donald Trump is getting richer\npublished_at: 2023-11-07T22:22:05+00:00\nsource: The Age\nExcerpt:\n-----\n40 Wall Street Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US664 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US270 million, New York\u2019s valuation: No current estimate available In valuing his flagship lower Manhattan office tower, Trump consistently ignored more conservative appraisals he\u2019d received from professionals, New York State argues. Trump has been accused of significantly over-valuing his flagship downtown New York property. Credit: Bloomberg For example, 40 Wall Street was appraised by a real estate company at $US200 million in 2011 and $US220 million in 2012. Despite this, Trump valued the property in financial statements at $US524.7 million and $US527.2 million, respectively, for those years.\n\nBloomberg uses a capitalisation of net income approach in coming up with an estimate. Valuations for commercial offices across the board have taken a hit in the past 18 months amid rising interest rates and a lacklustre corporate leasing market. But 40 Wall Street has its own unique problems.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Donald Trump defrauded banks with 'fantasy' to build his real estate empire, judge rules in a major repudiation against the former president\npublished_at: 2023-09-26T21:11:15+00:00\nsource: Fortune\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThe Trump Organization was convicted of tax fraud last year in an unrelated criminal case for helping executives dodge taxes on extravagant perks such as Manhattan apartments and luxury cars. The company was fined $1.6 million. One of the executives, Trump\u2019s longtime finance chief Allen Weisselberg, pleaded guilty and served five months in jail. He is a defendant in James\u2019 lawsuit and gave sworn deposition testimony for the case in May.\n\nJames\u2019 lawsuit does not carry the potential of prison time, but could complicate his ability to transact real estate deals. It could also stain his legacy as a developer.\n\nJames has asked Engoron to ban Trump and his three eldest children from ever again running a company based New York. She also wants Trump and the Trump Organization barred from entering into commercial real estate acquisitions for five years, among other sanctions. The $250 million in penalties she is seeking is the estimated worth of benefits derived from the alleged fraud, she said.\n-----",

He told TechCrunch that the case illustrates that \u201cthe tensions between merchants and the payment system providers are not over, and that litigation regarding this key cost faced by merchants is likely to continue for some time.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cPlatform companies that operate as gatekeepers in their market, such as PayPal, will continue to be the subject of antitrust litigation as a result of the significant fees they charge. PayPal\u2019s fees are, however, driven by the costs imposed upon them by the dominant card schemes, Visa, Mastercard and American Express.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Here\u2019s how Rainforest, a budding Stripe rival, aims to win over software companies\npublished_at: 2023-10-08T14:16:01+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\n$60M Series D support growth of e-commerce financier Clearco\n\nStitch raises $25M Series A extension led by Ribbit Capital, increasing the round\u2019s total to $46M\n\nResy and Eater co-founder raises $24M for Blackbird, a restaurant loyalty platform\n\nSparx wants to do for enterprise what Truebill did for consumer recurring bills\n\nTen Key Labs wants to simplify managing equity for startups\n\nSeen elsewhere\n\nLogistics company Loop raises $35M to modernize the supply chain (Also, check out TechCrunch\u2019s previous story on Loop.)\n\nShift4 acquires SpotOn unit for $100M (TechCrunch previously covered SpotOn here.)\n\nReserv raises $20M for AI-driven insurtech software\n\nVyzer raises $6.3M seed round for AI-powered wealth management platform\n\nKafene adds another $12.6M to its Series B round (TechCrunch previously covered Kafene here.)\n-----",

Here are a couple of other online sports betting sites that are thriving in other states, one or both of which could potentially come to Vermont eventually.\n\nCaesars Vermont promo code\n\nCaesars Sportsbook has become one of the most popular online sportsbooks in the US in several states, and it should prove a favorite in Vermont as well. We expect Caesars to offer the same offer in VT is has elsewhere, with new sign-ups eligible to receive up to a $1,000 Bonus Bet if their first bet loses.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Vermont Sportsbook Promos and Sports Betting Launch News\npublished_at: 2023-09-26T22:53:28+00:00\nsource: Sporting News\nExcerpt:\n-----\nWe'll stay tuned to see what happens with Fanatics Sportsbook VT.\n\nESPN Bet Vermont promo code\n\nESPN Bet Sportsbook has also applied to operate an online sportsbook in Vermont, and so it could soon be among the new online wagering options for Vermont bettors as well.\n\nESPN Bet brings a very familiar brand to sports fans, but a relatively new one when it comes to online sports betting. After acquiring the old Barstool Sportsbook earlier in the year, ESPN Bet Sportsbook launched the rebranded site in 17 different states in Nov. 2023. The site has already begun taking advantage of various tie-ins with the renowned sports programming network which has helped in the effort to establish the site in the overall marketplace.\n\nIn other states, the ESPN Bet welcome offer has included a 100% deposit match bonus worth up to $1,000 (with a 20x wagering requirement).\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Vermont Sportsbook Promos and Sports Betting Launch News\npublished_at: 2023-09-26T22:53:28+00:00\nsource: Sporting News\nExcerpt:\n-----\n2024. We are still awaiting word on what the Fanatics Sportsbook VT welcome offer will be. The site is live in several other states\n\nIn the past, Fanatics has featured different welcome offers for new sign-ups. These have included variations on the \u201cbet-and-get\u201d welcome offers described above. Fanatics has featured a bet $5, get $200 in Bonus Bets offer before. They have also structured the same offer differently by inviting new users to make five bets of at least $10 over five days and receive Bonus Bets each time they do, again totaling $200.\n\nFanatics Sportsbook has also taken advantage of the company\u2019s other major business as an official sports apparel and gear provider that partners with all the major leagues and teams. Drawing on that connection, Fanatics has sometimes made a free jersey, or, rather, money to spend in the Fanatics Store, part of a welcome offer to new users.\n\nWe'll stay tuned to see what happens with Fanatics Sportsbook VT.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Vermont Sportsbook Promos and Sports Betting Launch News\npublished_at: 2023-09-26T22:53:28+00:00\nsource: Sporting News\nExcerpt:\n-----\nWhen DraftKings Sportsbook Vermont launches, the site will feature the same multi-part welcome offer it has in other states: a $50 Bonus Bet just for depositing $5, another $150 in Bonus Bets for making a $5 wager, and a 20% deposit match bonus worth up to $1,000 in Bonus Bets.\n\nWhat can I win with the DraftKings Sportsbook welcome offer?\n\nDepending on how much in Bonus Bets you gather, you can win whatever you earn by placing successful wagers with them.\n\nWhat makes the DraftKings Sportsbook welcome offer better than others?\n\nDraftKings Sportsbook outdoes other sites with multiple offers rather than just one. Also, the $200 total in Bonus Bets you can receive just for depositing and wagering $5 is the best deal around, and you don\u2019t even have to win or lose your first bet. The deposit match bonus offer is unique as well, although not all new users will likely try to take advantage of it.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Vermont Sportsbook Promos and Sports Betting Launch News\npublished_at: 2023-09-26T22:53:28+00:00\nsource: Sporting News\nExcerpt:\n-----\nCaesars covers wide range of markets and different bet types while also featuring a terrific live betting platform. The site offers frequent odds boosts and other bonuses, and new sign-ups also get to join the famed Caesars Rewards program that can earn them more site bonuses among other benefits.\n\nHere are details explaining how the Caesars Sportsbook welcome offer works:\n\nWhen registering your new Caesars Sportsbook account, enter the bonus code NEWS1000 .\n\n. Place a first bet within 30 days and if it loses, receive back the equivalent amount in the form of a Bonus Bet worth up to $1,000 .\n\n. After that first bet has been settled, you\u2019ll see the Bonus Bet in your account within two days .\n\n. Use your Bonus Bet within 14 days or else it will expire.\n\nor else it will expire. If you win with your Bonus Bet, you only receive the winnings and not the bet amount back.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Vermont Sportsbook Promos and Sports Betting Launch News\npublished_at: 2023-09-26T22:53:28+00:00\nsource: Sporting News\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThose signing up at FanDuel Sportsbook Vermont by Jan. 10, 2024 will find $100 in Bonus Bets in their accounts when the site launches on Jan. 11. In addition, FanDuel Sportsbook VT will also feature the same welcome offer it has in other states, inviting new sign-ups to bet at least $5 and get $200 in Bonus Bets. Be aware that sometimes FanDuel add perks to that offer, such as they did at the start of the NBA season when they threw in a free three-month subscription to NBA League Pass.\n\nWhat can I win with the FanDuel Sportsbook welcome offer?\n\nWith the FanDuel offer, whatever you win with your Bonus Bets is yours to keep. If you can make some successful bets, that should mean a nice profit given the fact that with the prelive offer you received $100 Bonus Bets for free, and with the welcome offer you only have to make a $5 bet up front in order to receive the $200 in Bonus Bets.\n-----",
